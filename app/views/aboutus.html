        <p>The Southwest Fare Saver web app was created to supplement (southwest.com) when flying southwest. The app will [track] flights you have already booked to see if they get any cheraper. Current Southwest Policy allow you to rebook a flight for free and keep the difference in price. The app contains an improved [search] which will help you find flights with greater search criteria than southwest.com. Once these searches are setup, the app can follow the prices and alert you when the flights are cheap enough to buy. Lastly, the app will automatically check you in for flights, excactly 24 hours before the flight so you can get at the fron of the "A" boarding group</p>
